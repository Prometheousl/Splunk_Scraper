a few new things:\r\n\r\n@dan-v These probably don't fit what you're using it for, but you just laid such awesome groundwork!  If you don't want these messing up the repo I can maintain them in a separate fork.\r\n\r\n1 - Can now deploy lambda functions with VPCConfig:\r\nIf \"run\" launched with the -s (subnet ID) and -g (security group) flags, the lambda function will be deployed with a VPCConfig.  The \"AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole\" managed policy is now attached to the Execution Role as part of setup to facilitate this.  If the flags are not included, it will create the function with no VPCConfig.  *Note: If the VPC the function is launched into does not have a NAT Gateway it will not have access to the internet, preventing the reverse ssh tunnel from working. Which brings us to....\r\n\r\n2 - Can now specify the destination of the SSH target.\r\nIf \"run\" is launched with the -i option the parameter will be used in place of the public IP of the host running the awslambdaproxy.  This allows the tunnel to be set up using a VPC Endpoint Service.\r\n\r\n3 - Can now use instance roles.\r\nI removed the checks for environment variables from run.go.  This allows the SDK to use whatever permissions are set up on this host, including a .aws/credentials file or an instance

I appreciate your patience while I bring you an environment-related build error. \r\n\r\nAfter running `./mach build -d` I am receiving the following pip-adjacent

cannot import name main\r\n```\r\nIt would appear that my build fails during the `_activate_virtualenv` step of `python/mach_bootstrap.py`. [Specifically here](https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/python/mach_bootstrap.py#L224).\r\n\r\nOn my path, my `python` version is `Python 2.7.15` and my `pip` version is `pip 10.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip (python 2.7)`. Running on `High Sierra 10.13.4 (17E199)`. \r\n\r\n\r\nI did a little googling and found [this issue](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5221#issuecomment-382069604) which describes a similar breakage on pip 10.

If you don't want these messing up the repo I can maintain them in a separate fork.\r\n\r\n1 - Can now deploy lambda functions with VPCConfig:\r\nIf \"run\" launched with the -s (subnet ID) and -g (security group) flags, the lambda function will be deployed with a VPCConfig.  The \"AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole\" managed policy is now attached to the Execution Role as part of setup to facilitate this.  If the flags are not included, it will create the function with no VPCConfig.  *Note: If the VPC the function is launched into does not have a NAT Gateway it will not have access to the internet, preventing the reverse ssh tunnel from working. Which brings us to....\r\n\r\n2 - Can now specify the destination of the SSH target.\r\nIf \"run\" is launched with the -i option the parameter will be used in place of the public IP of the host running the awslambdaproxy.  This allows the tunnel to be set up using a VPC Endpoint Service.\r\n\r\n3 - Can now use instance roles.\r\nI removed the checks for environment variables from run.go.  This allows the SDK to use whatever permissions are set up on this host, including a .aws/credentials file or an instance role."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dan-v/awslambdaproxy/issues/comments/395166265","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-v/awslambdaproxy/pull/4#issuecomment-395166265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dan-v/awslambdaproxy/issues/4","id":395166265,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTE2NjI2NQ==","user":{"login":"dan-v","id":1596016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1596016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-v","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-v","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-v/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-v/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-v/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-v/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-v/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-v/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-v/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-v/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-v/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T18:21:22Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T18:21:22Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Gonna close this one out.
